# Gain/Loss Info

Gain/Loss Info is a free custom indicator for MT4 and MT5 coded by EarnForex.com. It calculates change of price or exchange rate for each candle and if it exceeds a given threshold, displays the change in % and points near the candles.

This indicator uses either Open-to-Close or Close-to-Close comparison for its calculations.
